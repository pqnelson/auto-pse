* References and Similar Software

- Norvig's [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/][Paradigms of AI]] are now free online
- Novak's [[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cgi/physdemod.cgi][Math, Physics problem solver]] is similar to what I'm interested
  in writing, although restricted and far more simple
  + ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/glarch/ is the code for the online
    problem solver
  + ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/cs381k/isaac/ is the original
    system Novak wrote, worth studying still
